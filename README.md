# Python-Freshman-Semester-1
These are Python programs that I wrote during my first semester of freshman year at Marist College!

To run one of my Python programs, you must have a Python interpreter installed. To write these programs, I used IDLE (Python v3.7).
1. Download one of my files from GitHub.
2. Extract it to any location of your choice.
3. Double-click the file to run it!
