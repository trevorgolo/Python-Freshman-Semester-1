You chose to go, despite warnings from others.
Do you choose to pack extra food and resources? (y or n): y
You chose to pack extra resources, just to be safe.
You must choose a vehicle to drive to the wilderness. You have three options:
A. Truck
B. Jeep
C. Mini cooper
Which vehicle do you choose to drive with? (a, b, or c): a
Good choice! Reliable and has enough space for the cougar!
You hop in your truck and drive out to the wilderness.
You rented out a cabin to stay in during your search for the cougar.
The cabin is getting uncomfortably cold, but there is a fireplace built into the cabin. Lighting a fire may attract unwanted attention, however.
Will you light a fire? (y or n): n
You decided against lighting a fire, and you are cold, but the creatures outside are unaware of your presence.
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a bundle of sticks. One of them looks especially promising. With the stick, you can:
A. Make it into a weapon to hunt the cougar.
B. Leave it alone.
C. Carve a message into the wall for the next resident.
What do you do with the stick? (a, b, or c): a
You successfully carved the stick into a weapon.
While walking around your cabin, you spot a sink that appears to have running water. There are no pipes that you know of anywhere nearby. You are getting somewhat thirsty.
Do you drink the water? (y or n): n
You chose not to drink the water. You become very dehydrated and begin to hallucinate.
While sitting inside your cabin, you hear a strange growling sound coming from outside. It could be the cougar. Do you:
A. Go outside and check.
B. Slightly open the door and look around.
C. Ignore the sound.
What do you do? (a, b, or c): b
You open the door slowly and carefully, but after having a quick look around, something pulls you outside into the wilderness.
Caught off guard, you look around, and find that your cabin has suddenly vanished, without a trace, along with all of your belongings. It is nearly pitch dark out and hard to see anything ahead of you.
Out of the corner of your eye, you see something moving and rustling in the leaves. What do you do?
A. Call out 'Hello?'
B. Make a cougar noise.
C. Do not make a noise.
Which do you choose? (a, b, or c): c
You chose not to call to it.
The creature walks in your direction, unaware that you are there, since you are standing still. What do you do?
A. Run away.
B. Try to assault it.
C. Remain silent and still.
Which do you choose? (a, b, or c): c
You remain completely still and silent, and realize that is a ghost of a person, and not the cougar. It whispers incomprehensible words into your ear, and then phases through you.
After it phases through you, you turn to look at it, and it seems to be motioning for you to follow it. Seeing no other option, you agree. In what fashion do you follow it?
A. Run after it.
B. At a slow and steady pace.
C. With swagger and pizzaz.
How do you follow it? (a, b, or c): b
You carefully follow the ghost, and it peacefully leads you to your truck, which appears out of thin air.
After walking to your truck, you notice that the ghost has placed the cougar, in mint condition, in the back of your truck. The ghost then points down the road, telling you to leave. What do you do?
A. Refuse to leave.
B. Comply and get in the truck and leave.
What do you do? (a or b): b
You accept, and get in your truck, which is already running, and you drive away.
While driving down the road, you see headlights coming at you from the direction you are heading. You are on a one-lane road, so it is strange for another vehicle to be heading in this direction. The road is very narrow, so it is nearly impossible to allow both of you to pass. What do you do?
A. Stay on course, heading straight for the other vehicle.
B. Swerve out of the way.
What do you do? (a or b): a
You confidently stay on course, heading straight for the other vehicle. You shut your eyes when impact is coming, but it does not come. The vehicle was a phantom, and you phase right through it.
As you are driving down the same road, a wolf jumps onto the hood of your car. Scared for your life as well as your cougar cargo, you must choose what to do.
A. Swerve around the road to try to make the wolf slip off the hood.
B. Do nothing, as it may be another hallucination.
C. Brake immediately to try to make it slip off the hood.
What do you do? (a, b, or c): c
You slam on the brakes, and it flies off the hood, landing on the ground in front of you.
You drive around the wolf, and speed away, leaving it in the dust.
You successfully drove back home, and recieved fame and fortune beyond belief!
You completed the game with a score of 12 out of 12! Congratulations!
Would you like to play again? (y or n): n
